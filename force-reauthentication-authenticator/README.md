# force-reauthentication-authenticator

## description

This authenticator, when added to the cookie section of browser flow, forces
reauthentication regardless of whether the OIDC (prompt=login) or the SAML
(ForceAuthN=true) client requested it, placing the decision with the IdP
operator rather than the SP operator.

## usage

This authenticator is not ready for use.
